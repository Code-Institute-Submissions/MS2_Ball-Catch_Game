# Ball Catching Game

## Project Summary

Code Institute Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development.

The objective of this project is to build a skill based game for rugby players and fans to catch balls.
I am an ex player and fan and spent a lot of time at full back. This meant catching a lot of kicks. 
I enjoyed this dynamic on the field and therefore decided to create a game version.
This game requires users to be alert and respond to the balls dropping as they would from kicks in a game.
The users must adjust their position in order to gather the ball. 
The user cannot let a ball drop or a life is lost. 
The user gets a score for each catch maintained on a counter and visible to the user.

# UX

#### Strategy

The overall aim of this project is to create a ball catching game for users to enjoy. 
The game must be possible to lose, and also scores made available to the user.

#### Scope

The site will include the game itself, with instructions on how to play, the ability to start the game,
lose the game, and track score. 

#### Structure

The website will be delivered on one page which is the game itself. 

#### Skeleton

The navigation will be limited to one page, but of course must be intuitive in terms of instructions 
on how to play and buttons to initiate. 

#### Surface

The format of the page will follow function where colour schemes align with a rugby field.
