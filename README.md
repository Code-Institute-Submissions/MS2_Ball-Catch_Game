# Ball Catching Game

## Project Summary

Code Institute Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development.

The objective of this project is to build a coordination based game for people of all ages to enjoy.
The concept of the game is an alien attack of earth and the only thing standing between this and 
the people is the defender of earth. 
As the fireballs are dropped the defender must defend their position to stop them hitting earth.
This game requires users to be alert and respond to the fireballs dropping.
The users must adjust their position in order to hit the fireball. 
The user cannot let a fireball drop or a life is lost. 
The user gets a score for each catch maintained on a counter and visible to the user.

# UX

#### Strategy

The overall aim of this project is to create a coordination challenging game for users to enjoy. 
The game must be possible to lose, and also scores made available to the user along with lives left.

#### Scope

The site will include the game itself, with instructions on how to play, the ability to start the game,
lose the game, and track score. Aside from the game, the user will be able to contact the developer.

#### Structure

The website will be delivered on two pages, where the home will become the game on game initiation, and the contact page.

#### Skeleton

The navigation will be simple to allow contact with the developer and return to home without using the back button.
It must be intuitive in terms of instructions on how to play and buttons to initiate. 

#### Surface

The format of the site will follow function. Colors, functions and navigation will keep UX to the fore.
